    description: "The Dacia Spring is a groundbreaking model that holds the distinction of being Europe's most affordable all-electric car. Based on the Renault Kwid/City K-ZE platform developed for emerging markets, it features a compact crossover-inspired design with a length of just 3.73 meters. The exterior styling incorporates SUV-like elements including increased ground clearance (151mm), roof rails, and protective body cladding, giving it a robust appearance despite its small dimensions. Powered by a modest 44 HP (33 kW) electric motor driving the front wheels, it prioritizes efficiency over performance, with 0-100 km/h acceleration taking around 19 seconds. The 27.4 kWh lithium-ion battery provides a WLTP range of approximately 230 km (143 miles) in the mixed cycle and up to 305 km (189 miles) in city driving. Charging options include standard household outlets (taking about 14 hours for a full charge), 7.4 kW wallboxes (5 hours), and DC fast charging up to 30 kW (80% in about 50 minutes). The interior is basic but functional, offering a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity in higher trims. Despite its compact exterior, it provides reasonable space for four adults and a 290-liter boot. A minor update in 2023 introduced the more powerful Spring Extreme with 65 HP (48 kW). The Spring represents Dacia's approach to electric mobility, making EV ownership accessible to budget-conscious buyers by focusing on essentials rather than luxury or high performance, particularly suited to urban environments where its compact dimensions and zero emissions are advantageous."
